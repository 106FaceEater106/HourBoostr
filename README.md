# HourBoostr
Boosting Steam account hours

This will allow you to boost Steam game hours on multiple accounts with no restrictions.
Run HourBoostr then set-up the Settings.json file.

Type each game ID under games that you want to boost like this:

```
{
  "Account": [
    {
      "Username": "ezzymaster",
      "Games": [
        730,
        346110,
        271590,
        252950,
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

You find the game IDs by going to the specific game you want to boost via the browser.
(You can also go via your Games page under your profile on Steam)

Set up all the accounts in the settings.json file then run HourBoostr.
Enter your password for each account and email code if required, then you can just leave it running on whatever server/computer you want!
