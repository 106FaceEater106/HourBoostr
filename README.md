Run HourBoostr then set up the Settings.json file to include the accounts you want to use, and which games you want to boost.
After setting it up you can just leave it running on whatever windows server/computer you want!

You can find the Steam game ids by going to the game store page of whatever game you want to boost.
For CSGO the store page is http://steamcommunity.com/app/730, and the id is 730
You can also use the Settings.exe game browser to find the game you want.

You find the game IDs by going to the specific game you want to boost via the browser.
(You can also go via your Games page under your profile on Steam)
http://steamcommunity.com/app/730 (730 is the GameID)
