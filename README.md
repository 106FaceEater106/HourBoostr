Example Settings.json setup
```
{
  "Account": [
    {
      "Username": "acc1",
      "Games": [
        730,
        271590,
        252950
      ]
    },
	{
      "Username": "acc2",
      "Games": [
        730,
        10
      ]
    },
	{
      "Username": "acc3",
      "Games": [
        730
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
